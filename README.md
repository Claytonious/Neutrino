Neutrino
========
A low-latency, high performance network library for real-time apps and games. Neutrino works either the full-blown CLR or with Unity3D, Xamarin, and other constrained and/or AOT runtimes. It is cross-platform and is regularly tested on Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android. It's well suited for use on both server and client or in a peer-to-peer topology.
